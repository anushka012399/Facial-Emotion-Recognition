# Facial_Emotion_Recognition
***Abstract***<br>
Facial expression analysis has evolved over the time, from recognizing expressions in simple
images to doing the same in a complex video. All the existing technology of facial expression
recognition comprise of three steps: face acquisition, facial extraction and identification of facial
expression. Facial feature extraction is done popularly by either motion-based method or
deformation of face. Motion based relies on recognizing the change of facial features over the
sequence of images. Analysis is performed either on specific areas of the face that are prone to
reacting in a certain way or in holistic manner wherein entire face is studied. Various study projects
have focused on employing machine learning techniques to identify emotions in real-time. Deep
neural network technique has been proved to perform with a better accuracy when compare to
SVMs and other neural networks. Several challenges in the analysis of facial expressions include
accommodation of factors such as age, race etc. The expression of the client/customer being served
at the counter is captured to predict the level of satisfaction. In this research work, I have used the
FER2013 dataset available to fine tune three models, namely: mini-Xception, ResNet-50 and
Inception-v3. ResNet-50 was found to have the best accuracy of 71.2%.
